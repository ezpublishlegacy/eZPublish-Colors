eZPublish Colors 0.2
====================

What ?
------

This repository contains the files needed to get an eZPublish's template syntax coloration file for gedit or any gtksourceview based editor (`ezpublish-template.lang`). You can also find a `ezpublish-template.xml` that your system will need to associate the `*.tpl` extension to the syntax file.
This repository uses eZPublish's 4.x template specs.

How ?
-----

You can use the installation script (`install.sh`) that will put both the `ezpublish-template.lang` and `ezpublish-template.xml` files at the right place (_no administrator privileges_ needed, everything will be installed in your home folder).
This install script was inspired form dandelionmood/Smarty-syntax-coloration-for-GEdit project on github
